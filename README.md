This is a simple website I made using Spring MVC and JPA to showcase some of my photography.

For now, this is just locally hosted, I intend to set it up to be able to be hosted on my personal computer soon, and I may purchase a domain for it at some point. 

TO BE DONE:
- some sort of system for tagging images, with each tag having its own table in the database, and an entry in said table being made with a FK to the associated Image
- make the slideshow images clickable through to their dispImg page
- move image files outside of project and into a folder on my computer (so no longer found directly in the repo)
- make the website hostable from my personal laptop, visible to the wider internet
- choose and purchase a domain name
- possibly host website full time through a hosting service
